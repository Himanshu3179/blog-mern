    "title": "12 Python Libraries that everyone should know",
    "content": "As far as user-interfaces go, most Python programs start out as command-line applications, and many remain so. It makes sense to offer your users the very best experience you can. For such programs, options are specified with command-line arguments, and the Python standard library offers the argparse library to help with that. argparse is a robust, solid implementation for command-line processing, but it is somewhat verbose to use. For example, here we have an extremely simple script that will add two numbers passed on the command line."
